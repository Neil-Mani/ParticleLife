Particle life simulations are very simple because they only follow one rule which is the gravity equation. The most base version of this project can be seen at <a href="neil-mani.github.io/ParticleLife">neil-mani.github.io/ParticleLife</a> .
However, if you want a more advanced verion, you should use the app. Many things such as the worms are ONLY possible in the app because you can set specific gravitational forces for each particle. Enjoy!
